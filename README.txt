CRIC-IN: C++ Cricket Match Simulator
====================================

Project Type: C++ Game Simulation Project
Developer: Reva Vasudev Chavhan
Platform: Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers (CDT)
--------------------------------------------------

Overview:
---------
CRIC-IN is a C++ console-based cricket match simulator that allows two teams to play a 6-ball over match.
The match conditions are affected by simulated weather (Sunny, Cloudy, Windy), and in case of a tie, a SUPER OVER is triggered.

Key Features:
-------------
- Class-based design with Player and Team classes.
- Randomized gameplay using standard C++ functions.
- Weather conditions affecting the outcomes of play.
- Super Over functionality in the event of a tie.
- Separate header (.h), source (.cpp), and main execution (.cpp) files for clarity.

Files Included:
---------------
1. main.cpp       - Entry point of the program
2. cric_in.h      - Header file containing class declarations and function prototypes
3. cric_in.cpp    - Implementation file for all game logic
4. README.txt     - This instruction file

How to Compile and Run:
------------------------
1. Open Eclipse IDE for C/C++.
2. Create a new C++ Project (e.g., CRIC_IN).
3. Copy the three files into the 'src' folder of the project.
4. Build the project (Project > Build All).
5. Run the project (green Run button).

Note:
-----
- Make sure you have a GCC/G++ compiler and Eclipse properly configured.
- No external libraries or frameworks are used.
- This is a fully original project tailored for Internshala's M5 final project evaluation.
